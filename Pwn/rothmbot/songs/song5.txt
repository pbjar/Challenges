Unexpectedly I'm falling in love
I want to be special to you
At first I thought it was impossible
But I feel something is different

"Stay beautiful like that"
Even if you say that
I don't know what that means
What is "me" to you?

I love you more and more
I also can't understand it
Do I have to pull or push?
If you just think and stay quiet
You can belong to someone else's
Hey, give me the best solution

...well, looks like I have to confess it
Haa...

Love pattern of "can say" & "can't say"
Realize me, please realize my feelings!
Why did you change the subject?

Even when we are close and look at each other
The feeling still can't be conveyed
Why are you a little insensitive to me?
Don! Like jumping with a bungee jump
All right, I'll say it!
"Actually I lo- lo- lo- lo- lo---"
Look at the cute bird over there----
Haa...

Wait a minute, time's up!
In the end, I got nothing
Many things happen in this daily life
It must be very troublesome, right?

"If you fall in love, you will be beautiful"
Isn't that what they said?
Of course I am like that every day
Besides, I can't get out of hand

But somehow you always
Act half-hearted to me
Even though I said "but I'm like this ..."
You answered "Isn't that better?"
You said it, right! Hey!

The love pattern is not black or white
What will happen? What will it be?
Tell me what's on your mind

However you think about it, we're not friends
However, this kind of distance is unusual, is it?
In the end, why are you still so insensitive?
it's better to say that kind of thing
"Actually I lo- lo- lo-------"

I always think about you, somehow it makes me cry
What exactly is this feeling?
Love, I know it

I want to be your "girlfriend"
I want to love you more!
I have to create the future
Move, me!

Love pattern of "can say" & "can't say"
Realize me, please realize my feelings!
Why did you change the subject?

Even when we are close and look at each other
The feeling still can't be conveyed
Why are you a little insensitive to me?
Don! Like jumping with a bungee jump
All right, I'll say it!
"Actually I love you"
