Rainchad is back at it again! Completely ignorning Nick Wu's advice on the greater likelihood of error when using fenwick trees, he decided to use the datastructure on a basic problem featured in a testing round. He removed the debugging feature, but I think it's still vulnerable. Can you pwn it?

You can find the problem at https://codeforces.com/contest/597/problem/C and his submission code at https://codeforces.com/contest/597/submission/128087011.
