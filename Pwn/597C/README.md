597C

Rainchad is back at it again! Completely ignorning xiaowuc1's advice on the greater likelihood of error when using fenwick trees, he decided to use the datastructure on a basic problem featured in a testing round. His code passed in codeforces, but I think he has an error somewhere. Time to pwn?

You can find the problem at https://codeforces.com/contest/597/problem/C and his submission code at https://codeforces.com/contest/597/submission/128087011.
