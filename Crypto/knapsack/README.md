Knapsack  
Rythm

Do you know why RSA is so hard to break? It is due to the fact that factorizing large numbers is very hard, and for now, there is no polynomial algorithm to do so (quantum supremacy be like). 

Well, why not use something harder than factorizing to make it even more secure? I'm talking NP hard.
